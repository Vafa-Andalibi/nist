  title: Alias
  description: |-

    A user may desire to create an alias for a resource. An alias may be used to
    more eaily remember a resource. A User can deploy a service in which such
    aliasses are stored. The aliasses could naturally be shared with other
    users. A resource could have one or more aliasses.  The reason for an alias
    is that a resource may have a complex name but a user may want to refer to
    the resource using a name that is suitable for the user's application.
