  title: alias
  description: |-

    A user may be interested to create an alias for a resource. This
    is a name useful to the user. Users can deploy an alias server in
    which they store such aliasses for resources. Such aliasses could
    naturally be shared with othere. A resource could have one or more
    aliasses.  The reason for an alias is that a resource may have a
    complex name but a user may want to refer to the resource using a
    name that is suitable for the user's application.
