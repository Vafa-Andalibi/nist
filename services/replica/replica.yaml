  title: replica
  description: |-
  
    In many distributed systems, it is important that a file can be
    replicated among different systems to provide faster access. It is
    important to provide a mechanism to trace the pedigree of the file
    while pointing to its original source. A replica can be applied to
    all data types introduced in this document.
