  title: organization
  description: >-
    An important concept in many applications is the management of a
    group of users in an organization that manages a Big Data
    application or infrastructure. User group management can be
    achieved through three concepts. First, it can be achieved by
    using the profile and user resources itself as they contain the
    ability to manage multiple users as part of the REST
    interface. The second concept is to create a (virtual)
    organization that lists all users within the virtual
    organization. The third concept is to introduce groups and roles
    either as part of the user definition or as part of a simple list
    similar to the organization.
